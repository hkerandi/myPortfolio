                Hi, welcome to the soft corner of my world 🌸<br><br>

                Over in Data Engineering, I build systems that scale.<br>
                Here? I build things that make me smile.<br><br>

            <h2>Diaspora Diaries (Under Construction)</h2>
            <p>An Afrofuturist travel diary that's part memory, part imagination, part sanctuary.</p>

            <h2>Tools that hold you</h2>
            <p>Tools That Hold You is a collection of gentle software experiments centered on care, reflection, and emotional awareness. 
                These tools are designed to support people in small, everyday moments—helping them notice, check in, and care for themselves before support becomes urgent. 
                By prioritizing rest over optimization, this work explores what self-care can look like when expressed through thoughtful, human-centered code.</p>
